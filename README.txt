Universal Dependencies for English as a Second Language (ESL)

===GENERAL===

Manual UD annotations for 5,124 sentences from the Cambridge Learner Corpus 
First Certificate in English (FCE) dataset. The annotations follow the 
standard English UD guidelines, along with a set of supplementary guidelines 
for ESL. The complete manual used by the annotators is available at
http://people.csail.mit.edu/berzak/tle_guidelines/guidelines.pdf

The sentences are split randomly to a training set of 4,124 sentences,
development set of 500 sentences and a test set of 500 sentences.

===DATA===

Due to FCE licensing restrictions, the annotations are released without 
the data. To merge the annotations with the corresponding FCE sentences, 
please follow these steps (require python).
1) Download the FCE dataset from http://ilexir.co.uk/applications/clc-fce-dataset/
to the current directory, thereby signing the FCE license agreement.
2) Unzip the downloaded file fce-released-dataset.zip. 
3) Run "python merge.py" to obtain annotation files with the FCE sentences.

===METADATA===

#ID=[document_id] [sent_id]: sentence identifier. 
doc_id is the path to the FCE document from which the sentence was obtained. 
sent_id is the sentence number (with respect to the automatic sentence tokenization).
#SENT=[sentence]: the error annotated xml version of the FCE sentence.
Available only in the merged version.
